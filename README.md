3. Resources and Thanks.

## 1. Installation
The app can be pulled from the Docker Hub, the image is debbyn1064/popgroup-app.
To rebuild, please follow the steps in the command.txt file.

## 2. The Purpose of the Application.
The application was created just to allow me to practice the various new skills that I have been 
introduced to in my course.
The application runs a website for a fictional pop group called the Pop Pythons, and it allows the 
fans to interact by taking polls on various questions regarding their songs and tours.
Very basic, but very colourful.
